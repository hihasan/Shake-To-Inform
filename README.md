# Shake-To-Inform

The meaning of creating a bug-free application is never developing any applications. At the production level, there is always no chance of informing about bugs or suggestions for a developer from the customer's perspective. 


"Shake to inform" is an Android Application that helps the user notify something wrong or suggestions to the developer.
